        Added common interfaces for various detailed physical layer functions
        such as FEC encoding/decoding, scrambling/descrambling,
        interleaving/deinterleaving, modulation/demodulation, etc. Also added
        generic interfaces for radio signal packet domain, bit domain, symbol
        domain, sample domain and analog domain representations.

        Added the following new interfaces:
        ISignalPacketModel, ISignalBitModel, ISignalSymbolModel,
        ISignalSampleModel, ISignalAnalogModel
        ILayeredErrorModel, ISymbol
        IEncoder ,IDecoder, IFECCoder, IInterleaver, IScrambler
        IModulator, IDemodulator,
        IPulseShaper, IPulseFilter
        IDigitalAnalogConverter, IAnalogDigitalConverter
